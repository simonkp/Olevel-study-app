            modelAnswer: "(a) **Particle B**. It has 10 protons and 10 electrons, making it a neutral atom. With 10 electrons, its electronic configuration is 2,8, which is a stable octet (Neon), making it an unreactive noble gas.\n(b) **Particles A and C**. They are atoms/ions of the same element because they both have 8 protons, but they are isotopes because they have different numbers of neutrons (8 and 10 respectively).\n(c) Particle D has 11 protons, so the element is sodium. It has 11 positive protons and only 10 negative electrons, giving it a net charge of +1. The symbol is **$Na^+$**.\n(d) Particle C has 8 protons (atomic number = 8) and 10 neutrons. Its nucleon number is 8 + 10 = 18. The nuclide notation is **$^{18}_{8}\\text{O}$**."
