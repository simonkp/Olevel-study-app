            modelAnswer: "(a) The acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution will turn from purple to colourless.\n\n(b) In sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), the oxidation state of oxygen is -2, so sulfur is +4. In the sulfate ion ($SO_4^{2-}$), the four oxygens give -8, so sulfur must be +6 to give an overall charge of -2. Because the oxidation state of sulfur increases from +4 to +6, the sulfur dioxide is oxidised. By being oxidised itself, it acts as a reducing agent.\n\n(c) The half-equation shows a 1:5 molar ratio between $MnO_4^-$ and electrons. Therefore, 0.2 moles of $MnO_4^-$ will require $0.2 \\times 5 = 1.0$ mole of electrons."
